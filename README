int_cast
--------

C and C++ forces you to be very careful when dealing with mixed typed integers
to ensure the correctness of computations and comparisons.

This cast allows you to safely cast a value from one integer type to another.
It handles all the error checking that one needs perform during the conversion
to ensure no information is lost. If the type cast cannot be performed without
losing information then an error is thrown.

The best way to deal with mismatched integer types in your code is to simply
limit the your integers to a single type like "int". This is works well with
code you write, but there are many APIs and language constructs that insist on
using "size_t". This cast allows you to work with these external APIs and
still maintain a high level of integer consistency in your code.
